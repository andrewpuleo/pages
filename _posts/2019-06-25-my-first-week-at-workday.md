Wow. I am so excited to say that I am interning as a Software Application Engineer at [Workday](https://www.workday.com/en-us/homepage.html) this summer! I only applied to a couple of internships and planned on going back to [PolySat](http://www.polysat.org/), the lab of which I'm a member at Cal Poly. When I got the offer I was thrilled. Workday has landed itself on as first on Fortune's [*Future 50*](http://fortune.com/future-50/) and Fortune's list of [*The World's Most Innovative Companies*](https://www.forbes.com/innovative-companies/#33c299131d65). I feel like I'm in a dream where I can fly, or won the lottery, and haven't woken up yet.

For my intern project I'm building, testing, and documenting a REST API to track costs which employees expense to their company. I was happy to hear that was my assignment because I built a REST API in a web development class this passed March. (I'll add a link here to a sample REST API I'm building with node.js once things have calmed down for the summer.) After I've built out the API, I'll build a front end to consume it, as a form of reference to go along with the documentation. Before I get to work on that though, I'll have to learn [XpressO](https://medium.com/workday-engineering/sneak-peek-into-workdays-technology-stack-1055bb5b06c7), Workday's proprietary programming language.

It's been a busy year, and it's going to continue that way. I regret neglecting this blog, but I'll pick up posting this summer. I think I'll have some exciting things to post! If you didn't click on any of the links, check them out because I'm truly excited about them.
