I'm Andrew Puleo. I'm a soon-to-be college grad. *Cross fingers, knock on wood.* I study computer science at [Cal Poly San Luis Obispo](https://www.calpoly.edu/). I'm particularly well known for bombing tests and acing coding projects. My proudest moment of college was passing Prof. Clint Staley's CSC305 course which boasted (?!) a 50% fail rate. After interning with [Workday](https://www.workday.com/en-us/homepage.html) in the summer of 2019, I accepted a full-time offer to return in ~~July~~ (thanks covid) September 2020.

# This Blog
I'm pretty new to this software thing. That is to say, I didn't go into college with much experience. So, I've pretty much been lurking for the past four years, observing and learning. I guess this is an attempt to stop lurking and start connecting. There are so many great social media tools like LinkedIn though, that I'll probably use this for long form content, or edge cases.

# Inspiration
Some great blogs that inspired me:
* [Coding Horror](https://blog.codinghorror.com/about-me/)
